# BlackJack
A simple web black jack game

Here we have a web BlackJack version using websockets. 

At the moment there are only some feautures:
1) Auth (no OAuth or session cookies)
2) Chat
3) online users list
4) readt/not ready player state tracker
5) in backend you can check out methods for game, such as taking cards, counting points, etc

(I just need to study more sprint topics to finish (ha-ha) this project)
